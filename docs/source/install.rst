Installation
============

``hydromass`` is available on `Github <https://github.com/domeckert/hydromass>`_ and `PyPI <https://pypi.org/project/hydromass/>`_.

The easiest way of installing ``hydromass`` is obviously to use pip::

    pip install hydromass

The PyPI repository should contain the latest stable release (as judged by the developer), it may not be the latest version thus some features may be missing. To install the latest version from Github::

    git clone https://github.com/domeckert/hydromass.git
    cd hydromass
    pip3 install .
    
``hydromass`` depends on numpy, scipy, astropy, matplotlib, pymc3, and pyproffit.
